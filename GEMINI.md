# Gem-in-eer

**The tools of the future!**

Gem-in-eer is a Red Alert 2 themed notification system for the Gemini CLI, inspired by PeonPing. It provides audio feedback for CLI events using iconic unit responses and commander briefings.

## Core Concept
- **Theme:** Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 (Soviet & Allied).
- **Integration:** Hook into Gemini CLI events (task completion, input required, errors).
- **Audio:** Play iconic sound clips (e.g., 'Unit Ready', 'Building', 'Insufficient Funds', 'Engineering!').
