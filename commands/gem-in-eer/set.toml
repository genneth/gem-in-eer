The user wants to set their sound pack. 

If they DID NOT provide a pack name, please run `powershell.exe -File ../../scripts/manage.ps1 -Action list`, show them the list of available packs, and ask which one they want.

If they DID provide a pack name ({{arg0}}):
1. Run the download script to ensure it exists.
2. Tell the user to run `gemini extensions config gem-in-eer "Active Pack"` to finalize the change, or explain that they can set the `GEMINEER_PACK` environment variable.
